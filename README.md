# AC Pro invoicing

### There's only one thing to configure, and that's your hourly earnings (in Program.cs)
<br>

-   Application currently working **ONLY** with **.csv** files
-   Application finding billing files **ONLY** in **Desktop** folder of **currently logged on user**
-   Application deploy is configured as single (.exe) file, so you can take it and place it anywhere you want

<br><br>

## Non-standard behavior:

### More files
-   When application found **more than one** billing file, the newest is used for billing
